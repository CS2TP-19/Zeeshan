### Project Name: EventTick

---

### Project Description:

EventTick is an ecommerce site that provides tickets to popular concerts across the UK. Our target demographic is young adults ranging from 18-25, and maybe a smidge over for those wild cards, ensuring we get them back out on the music scene. We were influenced by other ticket selling websites like Ticketmaster but differ by our focus on delivering on a user-friendly minimalistic interface that allows for easier and more fluid interactions for our users.​ Our project also come with a java database management system that allows for the streamlined addition of new producuts, updating status of orders and to generate reports for everything related to the site.
